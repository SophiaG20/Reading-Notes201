Reading Notes Class 01
**A Poem on HTTP and sending data between computers:**
> A cell interacts with another. A client requests to a 
> server. A server responds to a client. People may squander 
> with, "Which computer do you use?". They all connect using > metal and lightning. One person throws out a line to the 
> other. The line says "200 OK," and then it becomes two 
> people connected. <link> starts , more info, <script> then > some more. 0000000's and 111111111's. 

Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are "parsed" in the browser.

**Ever wonder how HTML, CSS, and JS files are "*parsed" in the browser? *(In what order does your computer read the site you are on)**
> The browser goes into HTML first going through the <link> to external CSS stylesheets and any <script>
> As the website parses the HTML, it sends back requests to the server for CSS files it has found from the <link> elements. So like a flubber, the ball bounces from one spot to the other and throws back signals to the other flubber what it is doing. Then, JavaScript files were found from <script> elements, which parsed the CSS and JavaScript.
>Sophia, what does that mean? It means that the computer has a certain way of showing you information, like a connects the dots; if you skip around, you will not guess what the image is.

### How can you find images to add to a Website?

Our class recommends to find an image, go to [google images](https://www.google.com/imghp?gws_rd=ssl). Many photos are copyrighted, so we recommend clicking on the Tools button and then the resulting Usage rights option that appears below. You should choose the option Creative Commons licenses. It is good practice to shout out where you got your photos. Images in web 2.0 is a very murky area, so please reach out to me so we can chat more on this.

How do you create a String vs. a Number in JavaScript?

What is a Variable, and why are they essential in JavaScript?

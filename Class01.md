Reading Notes Class 01
### **A Poem on HTTP and sending data between computers:**

> A cell interacts with another. A client requests to a 
> server. A server responds to a client. People may squander 
> with, "Which computer do you use?". They all connect using > metal and lightning. One person throws out a line to the 
> other. The line says "200 OK," and then it becomes two 
> people connected. <link> starts , more info, <script> then > some more. 0000000's and 111111111's. 

### **Ever wonder how HTML, CSS, and JS files are "*parsed" in the browser?:**
  
> The browser goes into HTML first going through the <link> to external CSS stylesheets and any <script>
> As the website parses the HTML, it sends back requests to the server for CSS files it has found from the <link> elements. So like a 
> flubber, the ball bounces from one spot to the other and throws back signals to the other flubber what it is doing. Then, JavaScript
> files were found from <script> elements, which parsed the CSS and JavaScript.
> Sophia, what does that mean? It means that the computer has a certain way of showing you information, like a connects the dots; if
> youskip around, you will not guess what the image is.

### **How can you find images to add to a Website?**

> Our class recommends to find an image, go to [google images](https://www.google.com/imghp?gws_rd=ssl). Many photos are copyrighted, so > we recommend clicking on the Tools button and then the resulting Usage rights option that appears below. You should choose the option > Creative Commons licenses. It is good practice to shout out where you got your photos. Images in web 2.0 is a very murky area, so 
> please reach out to me so we can chat more on this.

### **Things I want to know more about:**

> I would like to see someone show me these questions being shown in real life. 
> I also want to try more with HTML because I still feel rusty in it.

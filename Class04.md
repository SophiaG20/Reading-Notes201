# CSS Layout

## 1.What is meant by “normal flow”?

Normal flow
Normal flow is how the browser lays out HTML pages by default when you do nothing to control page layout. Let's look at a quick HTML example:

<p>I love my cat.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Buy cat food</li>
  <li>Exercise</li>
  <li>Cheer up friend</li>
</ul>

<p>The end!</p>

Elements on webpages lay themselves out according to normal flow - until we do something to change that. This article explains the basics of normal flow as a grounding for learning how to change it.

To explain how browsers layout web pages by default, before we begin to make changes.

Starting with a solid, well-structured document that's readable in normal flow is the best way to begin any webpage. It ensures that your content is readable even if the user's using a very limited browser or a device such as a screen reader that reads out the content of the page. In addition, since normal flow is designed to make a readable document, by starting in this way you're working with the document rather than struggling against it as you make changes to the layout.

## 2. What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

block-level : A Block-level element occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container), and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a "block".

blocl-level example:

<p>This paragraph is a block-level element; its background has been colored to display the paragraph's parent element.</p>

inline element: Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content.

inline example: 

<div>The following span is an <span class="highlight">inline element</span>;
its background has been colored to display both the beginning and end of
the inline element's influence.</div>

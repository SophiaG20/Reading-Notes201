1. Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

-The computer is logical, and it goes in sequence
-each element shows a different way to see a site
-because back then, there was very little diversity because the computers were simpler
-the elements are in a hierarchy, as were the predominant types of people making the rules. So like back in the day, people disappeared if someone did something out of line. For us, and these notes, you get werid behavior.
2. How many levels of headings are there in HTML? 6 <h1></h1> <h2></h2><h3></h3><h4></h4><h5></h5><h6></h6>
4. What are some uses for the <sup> and <sub> elements?
  solely typographical reasons = math and latin
  
5. When using the <abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?
For me, this would mean G20, and if you hovered over it, you would see Grzeskowiak-Amezquita. As G20 is an abbreviation. NEATO!

What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

Why should we avoid using inline styles?
  If you are starting out, using CSS inside the HTML might seem more straightforward, but in reality, it is very confusing. It is like if I put Spanish into an English term paper. Yes, I can read it, but the person after me will find it confusing. Therefore, it is better to group like with like.

## Learn HTML

## Ordered and Unordered lists

### 1. When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

> **<ul>** are and HTML element which
 represents an unordered list of items. Think of **<ul>** as bullet points in a PowerPoint when listing information **" in no particular order"**

### 2. How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

> 1. ***Most basic use*** : Would be used for a list of items whoes order is **"meaningless"**
  **<ul>**
    **<li>**
    **<li>**
  **<ul>**
  
> 2. ***Nesting  list*** : Could be used when making points and sub points such as..
>   **<ul>**I like dogs**
           **I like cats**
            **<ul>**
                **<li>**Tabby cats**<li>**  
                **<li>**Those multi coloures ones**<li>**
                    **<ul>**
                            **<li>**Tabby cats that are kitties**</li>**
                            **<li>**Tabby cats that have extra toes**</li>**
>   first item
    second item
    second item first subitem
    second item second subitem
    second item second subitem first sub-subitem
    second item second subitem second sub-subitem
    second item second subitem third sub-subitem

<ul>
  <li>I love to speak Spanish</li>
  <li>I love to learn English
  <!-- Look, the closing </li> tag is not placed here! -->
    <ol>
      <li>I use Dualingo the most</li>
      <li>Sometimes I talk with my co-worker who knows better English</li>
      <li>Rarely I pay for a tutor and it is expensive</li>
    </ol>
  <!-- Here is the closing </li> tag -->
  </li>
  <li>In the future I want to learn Arabic</li>
</ul>

### 3. When should you use an ordered list vs. an unordered list in your HTML document?

-the ordered list is to be used when the information presented is in a 1. 2. 3.... Step by Step: such as Math, Self-learning, recipes for food

-unordered lists could be used in a PowerPoint when sharing information that you thought of but is not essential in a matter or sequence: For example, People can be sad for many reasons
-Pandemic -Lost their job -issues with their pets...

### 4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

**In not particular order**
Using Roman Numeral type
<ol type="i">
  <li>Introduction</li>
  <li>Ways you are awesome</li>
  <li>Further Reading</li>
</ol>

Simple example
<ol>
  <li>Put the dog in the bathtub</li>
  <li>Rinse the dog with warm water</li>
  <li>Shampoo the puppy avoiding the eyes and lather well</li>
  <li>run water until the puppys coat is free of shampoo</li>
</ol>

Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.

### 1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?

### 2.Are the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

> const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];

## Things I want to know more about

I want to ask my programming friends to screen share in discord and show me how they would use most of the <ul>

I plan to dive into the internet and look for real-world examples on marginalized people's websites.

I want to see how the students in my class made examples.
